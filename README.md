# JSNative
The beginning of a way to make Native apps for the iPhone in Javascript (For FREE!)

This is a project I worked on when I was first learning how to write in Objective-C. Please forgive all of the horrible
attrocities inside the project, I was new at this.

This project attempts to render JSON and JS objects as native Objc objects. Haven't worked on it in years.
